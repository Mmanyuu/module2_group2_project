For this Web Weather Appplication UX user stories,
When enhancing the user interface (UI), user stories are instrumental in defining features that improve usability and user satisfaction.

1. As a user, I want to be able to customize the layout of my dashboard, so that I can arrange the information in a way that suits me.
2. As a user, I want to user friendly, so that I can input detail easily.
3. As a user, I want to have form validation to happen in real time, so that I can correct any errors as I fill out the form.
4. As a user, I want to be able to navigate the site using keyboard shortcuts, so that I can perform actions more quickly.
5. As a web app designer, I want to customize the toolbar layout in my design software, so that I can optimize my workflow.
6. As a user, I want tips to appear when I hover over complex controls, so that I can learn how to use the application.
7. As a user, I want the interface to adapt based on my device’s orientation, so that I can have a seamless experience in both landscape and portrait modes.
8. As a frequent user, I want the system to remember my preferences, so that I do not have to repeat selections each time I log in.
9. As a user with limited technical skills, I want any error messages to be easy to understand, so that I can resolve issues without external help.
10. As a user, I want the app to load quickly, so that I can use it effectively during short periods of free time.
11. As a user, I want offline access to this page, so that I can use the app without internet connectivity.
12. As a first-time user, I want to easily navigate the website’s menu, so that I can find the information I need without confusion.
13. As a frequent user, I want to personalize my dashboard view, so that I can quickly access the features I access the most.


Technical Presentation Guideline:

Create short slide deck;
 - Problem Statement
 - Technologies used - React, component, passing props, destructuring, State Hook, event handler, Unidirectional data flow (one-way data flow, which means the data has one, and only one way to be transferred to other parts of the application.)
   Context, Reducers, Conditional Rendering and Lists, Router, Axios, Asynchronous, useEffect and Deployment
 - Screenshots of the working application
 - Learnings of each member
 - Challenges encoountered during the project making

Lesson learn > on the Form with CRUD
to work with Array then > Dummy data

👉 git reflog
to find the the hash-number of that branch, then restore the deleted branch using

👉🏼 git checkout -b branch-name hash-number
